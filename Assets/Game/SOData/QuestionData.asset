  Questions:
  - QuestionText: The plastic bottle belongs in the blue bin
    Explanation: In Germany, plastic packaging like bottles goes into the yellow
      bin, known for recycling plastics and other packaging materials.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Pouring used cooking oil into the yellow bin is the correct way
      to dispose of it.
    Explanation: Small amounts of cooking oil can be absorbed in paper and placed
      in general waste; larger amounts should be sealed in a plastic bottle and thrown
      in the black bin
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Thermal paper receipts can go in the paper bin.
    Explanation: It is recommended that thermal paper (receipts) should go in the
      black bin because they are been coated with chemicals which are harmful to
      humans and the environment
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Broken mirrors and window panes belong in the glass container.
    Explanation: Mirrors, window glass, and ceramics are not accepted in glass recycling
      containers and should be taken to recycling centers.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Batteries should be disposed of at battery collection points.
    Explanation: Batteries contain harmful substances (such as Cadmium) and must
      be returned to battery collection points, commonly found in supermarkets or
      recycling centers.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: Hazardous waste like batteries can contaminate groundwater and
      soil.
    Explanation: When improperly disposed of, the chemicals in batteries can leak
      into the soil and contaminate groundwater, posing serious environmental and
      health risks. Proper disposal through designated hazardous waste collection
      points is essential to prevent this contamination.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: Flowers are not allowed in the bio bin.
    Explanation: Flowers, along with other plant-based materials, are allowed in
      the bio bin as they decompose naturally and can be turned into compost.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Food-soiled cardboard can only be recycled if the food is dry.
    Explanation: Food-soiled cardboard, whether the food is dry or wet, is generally
      not recyclable because the food residue contaminates the recycling process.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Black bin waste is sorted and recycled after collection.
    Explanation: Black bin waste, also known as residual waste, is typically not
      sorted for recycling after collection. It is usually incinerated to generate
      energy or sent to landfills.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: ' Electronics are disassembled to recover valuable raw materials.'
    Explanation: Electronics contain valuable raw materials such as gold, silver,
      copper, and rare earth metals. During recycling, devices are disassembled to
      extract these materials, reducing the need for mining and conserving natural
      resources.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: Sorting glass by color ensures quality in recycled products.
    Explanation: Sorting glass by color is essential because different glass colors
      (such as clear, green, and brown) have unique chemical compositions. Mixing
      colors during recycling can degrade the quality of the resulting product.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: It is safe to dispose of unused medication in the black bin.
    Explanation: Disposing of unused medication in the black bin is not safe because
      the chemicals can leach into the environment, potentially contaminating soil
      and water. Medications should be returned to pharmacies or collection points
      designated for safe disposal to ensure they are handled properly and do not
      pose a risk to public health or the environment.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Composting food waste reduces greenhouse gas emissions.
    Explanation: Composting food waste reduces greenhouse gas emissions because it
      prevents organic waste from decomposing in landfills, where it produces methane
      a potent greenhouse gas
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: Germany has a recycling rate of over 50%
    Explanation: Germany has a recycling rate of over 50% because it has one of the
      most efficient waste management systems globally. Through policies like the
      Packaging Act (Verpackungsgesetz) and the implementation of dual systems for
      sorting waste, Germany achieves high rates of material recovery.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: The average German generated less than 500 kg of waste in 2021
    Explanation: In 2021, the average German generated approximately 483 kilograms
      of municipal waste, which is slightly under 500 kg. This data highlights the
      continued efforts in waste management and reduction in Germany.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: A plastic bottle takes 450 years to decompose naturally.
    Explanation: Plastic bottles are made from materials like polyethylene terephthalate
      (PET), which are resistant to natural degradation. It can take approximately
      450 years for a plastic bottle to decompose in the environment.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: Hazardous waste like batteries can harm wildlife.
    Explanation: If these chemicals enter waterways or soil, they can harm wildlife
      by contaminating their habitat and food sources. Wildlife that comes into contact
      with hazardous waste may suffer from poisoning, reduced reproductive success,
      and death.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: 'Hazardous substance (e.g. Cadmium) from electronics are sorted
      out manually '
    Explanation: ' Manual sorting is a crucial step to ensure that these dangerous
      materials are safely handled and properly disposed of or recovered.'
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
  - QuestionText: By reaching a 60% recycling rate of municipal waste, the target
      of halving residual municipal waste will be achieved.
    Explanation: The target will be attained by achieving both a 60% recycling rate
      of municipal waste and reducing municipal waste by one-third
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Large amount of cooking oil is disposed of by putting it in a sealed
      plastic bottle and throwing into the black bin.
    Explanation: Small amounts of cooking oil can be absorbed in paper and placed
      in general waste; larger amounts should be sealed in a plastic bottle and thrown
      in the black bin
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:
    - False
    - Pour it in the yellow bin, as it's organic material
  - QuestionText: Greasy paper can go into blue bin
    Explanation: Greasy paper, such as pizza boxes or used paper towels, should not
      go into the blue bin for paper recycling. The oils and food residues contaminate
      the paper, making it unsuitable for recycling. They should go in the black
      bin.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: Ash is thrown into the black bin

  - QuestionText: Composting food waste can produce renewable energy
    Explanation: Composting transforms food waste into nutrient-rich soil through
      aerobic decomposition, which significantly lowers the environmental impact.
      This process also reduces the need for chemical fertilizers and helps improve
      soil health, further contributing to sustainability.
    CorrectAnswer: True
    WrongAnswers:

      or through mechanical processes for proper recycling and material recovery.
    CorrectAnswer: False
    WrongAnswers:
    - True
  - QuestionText: ' Hazardous electronic waste like batteries can harm human health'
    Explanation: When improperly disposed of, the chemicals in batteries can leak
      into the soil and contaminate groundwater, posing serious environmental and
      health risks. Proper disposal through designated hazardous waste collection
      points is essential to prevent this contamination.
